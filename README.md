# RVE-QGIS-Processing-Scripts
Python processing algorithm scripts for QGIS made by Remington &amp; Vernick Engineers

## Installation
Simply download the processing script(s) you want and put them in either a known procesing script path, or a new one and tell QGIS where to find it.
The paths setting can be found in Settings > Options > Processing > Scripts > Scripts folder(s)

## Tools

### Transect By Distance
This tool generates perpendicular lines of set distance along a line by a given offset. Useful for generating profiles of surfaces.
QGIS has a builtin transect tool, but it only generates at each vertex along a line.
